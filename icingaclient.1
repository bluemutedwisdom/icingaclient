.Nd generate a Windows installer for Icinga2
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm icingaclient
.Op Ar client_fqdn
.Op Ar client_address
.Op Ar parent_fqdn
.Op Ar parent_address
.Op Ar zone_name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program that creates a 'one-click' installer for a Windows-based Icinga2
client. The installer automates the enrolment of the node into an existing
Icinga2 cluster. 
.Pp
There are two usage modes. Arguments can be passed to
.Nm
from the command line. If no arguments are specified, 
.Nm 
will prompt the user for input. In the case where the parent zone name is not
equivalent to the parent's hostname, 
.Ar zone_name 
may be appended after all other arguments.
.Pp
.Nm 
is simply a collection of wrapper scripts. Firstly, icinga2(1) pki
commands are called for SSL certificate generation. 
Configuration files are then built for parent and client nodes. Finally,
nsis(1) bundles the generated files into a familiar 'exe' install wizard for
Windows.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Create an installer for a Windows host called 
.Pa dc01.business.com
whose parent Icinga instance is 
.Pa icingahq.business.com
.Dl $ icingaclient dc01.business.com 10.0.0.25 icingahq.business.com 10.0.0.15 

Configure a client in an icinga zone where the zone name is not the same as the
hostname of the parent. 
.Dl $ icingaclient dc01.business.com 10.0.0.25 icingahq.business.com 10.0.0.15 "master-zone"
